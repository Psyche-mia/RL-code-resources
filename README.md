# rl-code

A collection of Reinforcement Learning code resources, frameworks and environments. 
Every link below is a GitHub link so this is mainly focused on resources that are directly related to code.
For other types of resources check out [awesome-rl](https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl), 
[spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) and our 4 hour Reinforcement Learning course we created: 
[An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d3bxKoUn464ae_WQ2FFiFjmJPlWJI1GOydaDUAqVpJk/)

Feel free to raise issues, pull requests or email us at info@themtank.com for missing resources you think we should add. 

# RL Frameworks and design patterns
There really aren't many truly popular RL "frameworks" (i.e. the equivalent of DL frameworks 
but for RL) and there isn't even agreed upon formal design patterns/workflows that are common across all RL 
algorithm implementations. Also, the distinction between framework and "collection of algorithms" is
 hard to specify sometimes. Therefore, the below list is mix within this continuum as well as some RL courses.

##### TODO 
- add image comparing 3D house environments
- add more images in general
- split environments into different types e.g. 3d houses, 2d, control, etc
- Other self-driving envs
