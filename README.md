# rl-code-envs-frameworks

A collection of Reinforcement Learning code resources, frameworks and environments. 
Every link below is a GitHub link so this is mainly focused on resources that are to do with code.
For other types of resources check out [awesome-rl](https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl), 
[spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) and our 4 hour Reinforcement Learning course we created: 
[An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d3bxKoUn464ae_WQ2FFiFjmJPlWJI1GOydaDUAqVpJk/)

Feel free to raise issues and pull requests for missing resources you think we should add. 

# RL Frameworks and design patterns
There really aren't many true RL frameworks (the equivalent of DL frameworks but for RL) or even 
formal design patterns/workflow that are common across all RL algorithm implementations. 
Also, the distinction between framework and "collection of algorithms" is hard to specify sometimes. 
Therefore, the below list is mix on this continuum as well as some RL courses.
