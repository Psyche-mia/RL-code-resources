# RL-code-resources

A collection of Reinforcement Learning code resources, frameworks and environments. 
Every link below is a GitHub link so this is mainly focused on resources that are directly related to code.
For other types of resources check out [awesome-rl](https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl), 
[spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) and our 4 hour Reinforcement Learning course we created: 
[An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d3bxKoUn464ae_WQ2FFiFjmJPlWJI1GOydaDUAqVpJk/)

Feel free to raise issues, pull requests or email us at info@themtank.com for missing resources you think we should add. 

# RL Frameworks and design patterns
There really aren't many truly popular RL "frameworks" (i.e. the equivalent of DL frameworks 
but for RL) and there isn't even agreed upon formal design patterns/workflows that are common across all RL 
algorithm implementations. Also, the distinction between framework and "collection of algorithms" is
 hard to specify sometimes. Therefore, the below list is a mix within this continuum as well as some RL courses.
